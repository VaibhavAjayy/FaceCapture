## About the project
Abstract: -
The face is the crucial part of the human body that uniquely identifies a
person. Using the face characteristics as biometrics, the face recognition
system can be implemented. The most demanding task in any organization
is attendance marking. In the traditional attendance system, the students
are called out by the teachers and their presence or absence is marked
accordingly. However, these traditional techniques are time-consuming
and tedious. In this project, the Open CV based face recognition approach
has been proposed. This model integrates a camera that captures an input
image, an algorithm for detecting a face from an input image, encoding
and identifying the face, marking the attendance in a spreadsheet and
converting it into a CSV file. The training database is created by training
the system with the faces of the authorized students. The cropped images
are then stored in a database with respective labels. The features are
extracted using the LBPH algorithm.

Introduction :- 
Nowadays, educational institutions are worried about student attendance
consistency. This is mostly owing to the fact that a student's attendance at
the institute has an impact on his or her overall academic success. Calling
out the roll call or having students sign a piece of paper is the two most
common ways of recording attendance. They were both more time
consuming and challenging. As a result, a computer-based student
attendance management system is required, which will aid instructors in
automatically keeping attendance records. We used PYTHON to develop
an automatic attendance system for this project. We have outlined our
plans to create an "Automated Attendance System Based on Facial
Recognition," which would encompass a wide range of applications. As a
result, this technology may be used in an area where attendance is critical.
The system is built on the Python programming language. Local Binary
Patterns Histograms (LBPH) (1996) & Haar Cascade are the algorithm
used in the suggested system.
Statement of the Issue Every school, college, and university keep track of
every student's attendance. There is a substantial association between
students' attendance and their academic success, according to empirical
studies. There was also a report that pupils with poor attendance records
have a higher chance of dropping out. As a result, educators must keep
accurate attendance records. The manual attendance record method is
inefficient, requiring extra time to organise records and determine each
student's average attendance. As a result, a system that can tackle the
problems of student data organisation and average attendance
computation is needed. Facial recognition is one option for making the
student attendance system automated.
